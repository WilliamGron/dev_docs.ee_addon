# Structure

[Structure](http://buildwithstructure.com) is used to better manage the majority of our URLs (foregoing the template\_group/template approach EE does out of the box). We use Structure to also help the client see (and easily re-arrange) their site's Pages hierarchy.

Structure has some handy tags in use across the site. The HTML Title is built with Structure. The sub navigation is all built with Structure. The primary navigation, however, is not. (That is hard-coded in the embeds/\_main\_menu template.)

Structure allows for the customizing of templates on a per-entry basis. We use that on a few entries and that is the sole reason for the entire "specific\_pages" Template Group.
